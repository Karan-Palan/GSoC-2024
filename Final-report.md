## Project Details

The [**Music Blocks v4**](https://github.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks-v4) project is “_a complete overhaul of the original Music Blocks project_”, which was derived from the [Turtle Blocks](https://github.com/sugarlabs/turtleblocksjs) project. The existing implementation ([Music Blocks](https://github.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks)), which started in 2015 using native Vanilla JavaScript, lacks modern front-end tooling and ecosystem standards, leading to difficulties in maintenance and subpar performance. The v4 project uses improved application architecture, modern tools (such as Vite, ESLint, Prettier, Docker, Jest, Cypress, etc._), better languages (_TypeScript and Sass_), and libraries (_React for UI rendering_). This will significantly enhance the overall developer and user experience, maintainability, and performance. The project focuses on implementing one of the main features of Music Blocks, the "**Masonry Framework**", which is currently missing in the new version (v4). The Masonry Framework is a graphical block manager module which is used to create Music Blocks programs, including interactive blocks like _Start, Rhythm, Note, Pitch, Instrument_, and many more. These blocks can be dragged, dropped, and clicked to perform actions. By implementing the Masonry Framework, users will be able to create different musical patterns seamlessly. This will bring the v4 project on par with the capabilities of the old version and provide a more accessible, efficient, and user-friendly application for users to create music through an interactive web application.
